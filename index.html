    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a clinician, educator, and health systems advocate specializing in Anaesthesia and Critical Care, with over a decade of experience
      working in resource-limited environments. My academic and clinical journey has been guided by a single mission: to improve the quality,
      accessibility, and equity of critical care for all patients — particularly in lower-middle-income countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trained in both clinical medicine and health systems strengthening, I have played a leading role in national efforts to improve sepsis care,
      shape brainstem death legislation, and advance quality improvement initiatives in intensive care. One of my proudest contributions has been
      leading the development of Kenya’s first national Critical Care Registry — a transformative tool that supports clinical care, drives research,
      and informs health policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a woman in academic medicine, I am deeply committed to mentorship, interprofessional education, and empowering the next generation of clinicians
      and leaders. I have trained and supervised hundreds of residents, fellows, nurses, and medical officers, using bedside teaching, simulation-based
      learning, and systems-level thinking to build confident, competent, and compassionate teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      My portfolio bridges the domains of clinical excellence, policy influence, and academic scholarship. I believe that the most meaningful change happens
      when education, advocacy, and evidence come together — and I strive to make that convergence a reality every day.
